# CSCI440 Assignments

There will be at least 6 assignments due at approximately 2 week intervals starting the second week of the semester.

For the first assignment, you will need to use a Linux virtual machine. All assignments must be able to work in a UNIX-based environment such as Linux â€“ programs submitted to INGInious will be tested using the GNU compiler (gcc, a standard compiler for many modern Unix-like operating systems).

## Assignment Instructions

* **Assignment 1: Writing a Kernel Module**
  * [CSCI440-KernelHacking](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-KernelHacking)
  * Goal: For you to become more familiar with how kernel modules are written and aspects of the Linux operating system using these modules
* **Assignment 2: Writing Your Own UNIX Shell**
  * [CSCI440-Shell-Assignment](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-Shell-Assignment)
  * Goal: For you to get practice with exceptional control flow.
* **Assignment 3: Writing a Scheduler**
  * [CSCI440-Scheduler](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-Scheduler)
  * Goal: For you gain insight into how schedulers work on the system.
* **Assignment 4: Virtual Paging**
  * [CSCI440-Virtual-Paging-Assigment](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-Virtual-Paging-Assignment)
  * Goal: Implement a paging strategy that maximizes the performance of the memory access in a set of predefined programs.
* **Assignment 5: DNS Resolver (Threads Only, Mutex/Semaphores)**
  * [CSCI440-DNS-Name-Resolution-Engine](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-DNS-Name-Resolution-Engine)
  * Goal: Develop a multi-threaded application that resolves domain names to IP addresses. Your application should synchronize access to shared resources and avoid deadlock, using mutexes and/or semaphores to meet this requirement.
* **Assignment 6: DNS Resolver (IPC)**
  * [CSCI440-DNS-Name-Resolution-Engine-IPC](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-DNS-Name-Resolution-Engine-IPC)
