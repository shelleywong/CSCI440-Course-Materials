## Course Accounts

* INGInious
  * Go to [https://inginious.csuchico.edu/](https://inginious.csuchico.edu/) and sign-in with your campus account -- make sure to set your username to match your campus username if you haven't already.
  * INGInious is the new CSCI assignment submission system. **YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUBMIT MOST OF THE ASSIGNMENTS IF YOU DO NOT CREATE THIS ACCOUNT**
  * The system uses the Shibboleth campus authentication portal for sign in, and the campus VPN is required for access. See Canvas for details on creating an account, enrolling in the correct course, and submitting assignments.
* Canvas
  * [Chico State Canvas](https://canvas.csuchico.edu/) - Make sure you can access CSCI 440 on Canvas.
* PollEverywhere
  * [Login/Create Account](https://www.polleverywhere.com/auth/saml/csuchico) - If you have not already done so, create an account and login to PollEverywhere. PollEverywhere will be used during lectures for feedback and to track participation. There is a campus license for PollEverywhere and for your participation to be registered, your account must be tied to your csuchico email.
  * [pollev.com/techturtle](https://pollev.com/techturtle) - This is the PollEv link that will be used during lectures throughout the semester.

## Textbook

We will be making use of a free, yes **free**, operating textbook that I feel offers a more technical and up to date presentation of the OS topics. This is a change from the previous semesters. I have linked the recommended chapters for the weekly readings on the [readings page](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI440-Course-Materials/blob/main/Readings.md), but for reference here are the details:

**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**
Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau
Arpaci-Dusseau Books
March, 2015 (Version 0.90)


This textbook also offers simulators for a number of the topics with homework assignments at the end of many of the chapters that will be helpful to conceptualize some of the difficult topics for this course. I've selected some of the key ones I would recommend as well as timing and included these on the [labs](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI440-Course-Materials/blob/main/Labs.md) page.

In addition to this free textbook, you may also benefit from renting the following book to help with the [second assignment](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI340/CSCI440-Shell-Assignment) (Writing Your Own UNIX Shell) for the course. This assignment is adapted from Chapter 8 of this textbook.

**Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective**
by  Randal E. Bryant, David R. O'Hallaron
3rd Edition: (2016) Pearson ISBN-10: 9332573905
2nd Edition: (2010) Addison-Wesley ISBN-10: 0136108040

You can borrow this book through [Meriam Library](https://library.csuchico.edu/) or purchase it (last I checked, Amazon had a paperback version of the 3rd edition for about $40).

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance for lectures and labs is not required (it is not directly factored into your grade); however, **regular attendance is strongly encouraged** — students who actively engage with the course in real time tend to perform better overall. Lecture attendance and participation will be tracked through PollEv responses, and Lab attendance will be tracked through a sign-in sheet.

To recognize that effort, students who attend and participate in 80% or more of lectures and labs will receive up to 5% bonus credit on their final course grade. If your attendance is below this threshold, you may still earn a proportional bonus, depending on how regularly you participated. The bonus is meant as a recognition of consistent engagement, not a punishment for occasional absences.

Missing class can make the projects and exams especially difficult. If I verbally change the requirements of a project during lecture, you are responsible for meeting the new requirements. During labs, we will walk through examples of the material covered in lecture and tools for your assignments, so attendance can improve your chances of succeeding on these tasks. If you miss a class, make sure you get notes from another student.

If you regularly skip class, do not expect me to answer questions on the material you missed. If you need to miss occasionally for legitimate reasons, please make sure to communicate with me, reference any provided materials, and feel free to ask questions on the material you missed.

I understand that things happen, so if you need to miss a lecture or lab for any reason, send me an email ASAP with an explanation of your situation (ideally BEFORE the class you need to miss, but after is better than not letting me know at all). Depending on the circumstances, you may be excused for the absence and given partial credit for the class(es) you need to miss. Legitimate reasons for needing to miss class include illness or health-related issues, family or personal emergencies, required legal obligations, official academic or university commitments, and severe weather or natural disasters.

## Grading

Check Canvas to see your currently available grades, and let me know as soon as possible if you have questions about your grades. If you do not get in touch with me promptly (i.e. within a week of the posting of a grade), I will assume you think the grade is fair and accurate. During the semester, your overall/total grade displayed on Canvas may differ from your actual current total grade due to various circumstances, such as attendance (which will not be updated regularly on Canvas) or if you have a missing assignment.

### Grade Category Percentages:

+ Programming Projects 60% of course grade

+ Final Project 20% of course grade

+ Exams 18% of course grade (1 midterm in person)

+ Canvas Quizzes 2% of course grade

+ Lecture and Lab Attendance and Participation - up to 5% credit

### Grading Meetings

We are going to investigate all the projects you turn in to look for code plagiarism via a number of different methods. Any students whose code isn't uniquely yours will need to schedule a grading meeting with the grader to answer detailed questions concerning how your code works. This meeting will make up 60% of your project grade and 40% will come from your ability to solve the project. If you didn't write your project you will likely fail the grading meeting and get a failing grade on the project. Seeking out fellow students for advice on how to get started is perfectly acceptable; however, do your own work and make sure you have a firm understanding of how your code works.

## Programming Assignments

There will be at least 6 assignments due at approximately 2 week intervals starting the second week of the semester.

For the first assignment, you will need to use a Linux virtual machine. All assignments must be able to work in a UNIX-based environment such as Linux – programs submitted to INGInious will be tested using the GNU compiler (gcc, a standard compiler for many modern Unix-like operating systems).

### Late Assignments

Assignments turned in 1-48 hours after the due date will lose 15%. Assignments will NOT be accepted more than 48 hours after the due date.

That said, I understand that unexpected challenges can come up. If you are facing a serious or unavoidable situation, please come talk to me — I may allow a late submission at my discretion **if you communicate with me directly, in a timely manner**. Depending on the situation, there may be an additional deduction in points; however, if you’re overwhelmed or running into issues, I don’t want you to give up. I would rather you have a conversation with me than miss assignments entirely.

## Final Project

In lieu of a final exam, there will be an inquiry-based final project. You will answer one of the recommended questions (provided in the final project instructions). You may propose a different question, but you must get it approved ahead of time. The final project will be evaluated based on a paper you have written (see assignment write-up for more details) and the code for your project.

## Dropping and Adding

You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures about add/drops, academic renewal, etc. found in the [CSU Chico University Catalog](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/academic-standards-policies/). You should be aware of the new deadlines and penalties for adding and dropping classes.

## Responsibilities

Adapted from Professor Tyson Henry's 211 syllabus as it's a good statement concerning responsibilities for any given course:

My responsibility is to deliver engaging and informative lectures, along with assignments that are meaningful and provide an appropriate level of challenge. My goal is to aid you in your learning process and enhance your programming confidence. If you require assistance, have concerns, or seek clarifications, please do not hesitate to communicate with me.

Students are responsible for dedicating the time and effort necessary to learn the material. The amount of time and effort required varies drastically. It may take you two hours/week to get an A in this class. It may take you 20 hours/week to get a C. It is your responsibility to figure out how much time you require and to invest that amount of time appropriate for you.

## Honesty and Academic Integrity

Academic honesty and integrity play an important role in a high-quality learning environment. I expect all students to understand and follow the University’s [Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.csuchico.edu/pres/em/2024/24-048.shtml). Violations of academic integrity include but are not limited to cheating, unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and misuse of sources. The first time you violate academic integrity, you will be warned, and you will get a 0 on the test or assignment. The second time you violate academic integrity, you will fail the class. Violations are reported as Academic Integrity Incidents to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the Policy on Academic Integrity and help build a campus culture that recognizes and upholds these values. If there is anything that you do not understand in the policy, make sure to ask.

The bottom line is that you are responsible for learning the material and completing your own assignments. Cheating will make it much more difficult for you to succeed in the long run. Not all cheating looks the same. **Here are some examples that violate academic integrity**:

* copying code from another student
* copying code from a book
* copying code from the Internet
* getting your friends to write your code
* paying someone else to write your code
* pestering other students until they give you their code
* buying code
* stealing code
* using Artificial Intelligence to generate your code or do your assignments (includes Large Language Models such as ChatGPT)
* letting someone steal your code (e.g. giving out your password, or using incorrect file protection)
* putting your code in a public repository (e.g. on GitHub) – Note: it is easy for people to steal code from a public repo, but putting your code in a private repo is welcome and encouraged! Please ask if you have questions about how to use git appropriately!
* giving your code to another student (both giving code and taking code are forms of cheating)
* giving your laptop that contains your program to another student
* getting so much help on an assignment that you are no longer doing the assignment (this can come from one helper or many helpers)
* crowdsourcing your code
* self-plagiarism (Re-use of a student's original work, in part or in its entirety, without the express permission of the course instructor)
* presenting the ideas or works of another as one’s own
* presenting work without customary and proper acknowledgement of authorship (i.e. use the appropriate citation of sources when applicable)
* the list goes on...

Even if you are not submitting plagiarized work, it is considered academic misconduct if you facilitate or aid in academic dishonesty, steal instructional materials or tests, try to alter grades, use personal relationships to falsely increase grades, or otherwise attempt to obtain grades through fraudulent means.

**If you are taking this course again after an unsuccessful previous attempt**, you are advised to start from scratch on all assignments -- not doing so will cheat yourself and likely make you more prone to failure later in your academic career.

**I reserve the right to catch academic integrity violations after the end of the semester**. Students who cheat and make it to the end of the semester without being caught may still get caught in the future. We keep records of all assignments and use programs that look at all instances of an assignment over the past years, so it is possible for us to catch cheating after the fact (e.g. if a student who takes the class this semester gives their code to a student who will complete the class next semester). It is possible to change grades after they have been posted, even after you graduate. I would prefer not to do this, so please do not put me in the situation where I need to.

### AI Policy

As most of you are well aware, generative A.I. tools are widely available. There are ways to use these tools responsibly that are allowed in this course:
* Brainstorming ideas or exploring different ways to approach a problem
* Clarifying concepts or enhancing your understanding of operating systems
* Asking questions similar to how you would use a search engine

However, you may not use AI tools to generate code for assignments or projects, and you may not use AI during exams (which are in-person and on paper). Submitting AI-generated code may be treated as unauthorized assistance and considered a form of plagiarism. **All submitted code must reflect your own understanding and effort**.

Using AI as a shortcut will ultimately undermine your learning in this course, especially in a subject like operating systems, where deep understanding of systems-level behavior is essential. **It is important to remember that AI-based tools like LLMs do not reliably provide accurate or optimal solutions**. Even built-in tools like GitHub Copilot can get syntax wrong and give you code that looks valid but does not accomplish what you want. AI tools can end up ADDING to your workload, by making your code more complicated or by providing “solutions” that do not work. **Do not resort to using AI tools so much that you forget how to use debugging tools, read documentation, interpret and understand code written by other people, and develop good search engine prompts** – these are all skills that you need to practice and cultivate if you want to be a better developer in the long run.

Writing good prompts and interpreting AI output is a real skill — but it should not replace human creativity, critical thinking, or problem-solving. If you do use AI tools at any stage, you must clearly cite that usage in your submission (e.g. a brief note in comments or a README file documenting the specific prompts you used and the responses generated by the AI tool). Note that disclosure of AI use is becoming an expected practice in both professional and academic settings.

If you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is appropriate, ask first. You should also recognize that other instructors may have different policies – you cannot assume that one instructor’s policies apply to all of your other courses.

## Communication/Getting Help

If you are stuck or need help, remember that there are resources available, including:

* **Class Materials**
  * Lecture content, slides, assignment instructions, textbook readings and examples, and links to resources provided in class material should be your starting point for CSCI 440 assignments.
* **Lab, Student Hours, and Email**
  * Feel free to make use of my office hours, send me an email, or ask during lecture or lab if you have any questions.
  * If you are sending me an email, make sure you put 'CSCI440' in the subject so it will be filtered correctly; otherwise, I may not open your message or respond to it.
* **Lab Assistant, Tutors, or other students on the unofficial student-run Chico State CS Discord**
  * Communicating with other students about assignments is not a bad thing in itself -- just remember that sharing code, copying code, and posting code to a discussion board (or any public place) may be considered cheating.
  * If your question is related to your code, and your question requires that you show another person your code, send me an email or potentially see if someone can help you individually, without you posting code in a public place.
  * Occasionally, tutors help too much (enough so that a student's code does not appear to be uniquely their own), so make sure you have a firm understanding of any code you submit in case you are called in for a grading meeting.
* **References, Official Documentation, Man Pages**
  * I do not expect you to know everything -- I encourage you to use standard search engines and documentation if you would like to gain more understanding or need assistance for an issue not covered in class.
  * Sometimes examples and advice found on the Internet can be outdated and/or incorrect – do not be surprised if the first thing you try does not work! Being open to trying a different method or taking a different approach will benefit you in the long run.

I try to respond as soon as possible to emails. If I have not responded within 24 hours, you may try sending a follow up email if you are still running into issues.

I will communicate with the class via email and announcements on Canvas. It is your responsibility to check these messages regularly so that you do not miss important information about the class.

## Resources

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

I am firmly committed to creating a learning environment that is welcoming and inclusive for all students, including specifically women, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Indigenous individuals, people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and individuals who do not fit the “traditional” profile of a computer science student – those who have been historically underrepresented in the computer science field. Diversity of experiences and perspectives enriches the learning process for everyone, and I am committed to providing all students with the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background.

Creating a respectful, inclusive, and safe learning environment is our shared responsibility, and the success of this policy relies on the support and understanding of all members of this class. I encourage you to treat each other with kindness, refrain from offensive behavior, and stand against any form of harassment or discrimination, so we can collectively build a positive and enriching educational experience for everyone.

:wave: Everyone is welcome here! :rainbow:

### Accessibility Resource Center

A student who desires accommodation for a disability must submit appropriate documentation of the disability and request for accommodations to the [Accessibility Resource Center](https://www.csuchico.edu/arc/). ARC accommodations for exams must be requested at least seven days in advance.

### Religious Holidays

I will work with students so this class and its assignments, exams, and activities do not interfere with religious holidays. However, you must notify me ahead of time so we can make appropriate arrangements.

### Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting

Pursuant to CSU policy, I am required to report to the Title IX Coordinator whenever I learn about incidents of sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, or stalking that affect any member of the campus community. This includes disclosures that occur during our class discussions or in private. Students may make a confidential report to the Counseling and Wellness Center or Safe Place. Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available on the [Title IX page](https://www.csuchico.edu/title-ix/) of the CSU Chico website.

### Chico State Basic Needs Project

**The Hungry Wildcat Food Pantry** provides supplemental food, fresh produce, CalFresh application assistance and basic needs referral services for students experiencing food and housing insecurity.

All students are welcomed to visit the Pantry located in the **Student Service Center 196**, open **Monday-Friday, 11am-4pm** or call **530-898-4098**. Please visit the Chico State Basic Needs website [http://www.csuchico.edu/basic-needs](http://www.csuchico.edu/basic-needs) for more information

### COVID-19

Per [CSU policy](https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/11030468/latest/) effective April 6, 2023, COVID-19 vaccinations and booster shots are strongly encouraged, but no longer required for students and employees. Policies and requirements regarding COVID-19 are subject to change pursuant to campus, local, state and/or federal guidelines. You will be notified about any updated requirements.
